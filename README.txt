* Folder:"ReconstructME" contains all the data and figures presented in the 3D imaging manuscript: "Journal_draft_v20"

1. Before generating the figure data, please include the function packages "ReconstructMe\Matlab Codes to be Included" to MATLAB:
   --> open MALTAB-> HOME-> Set Path-> Add with Subfolders-> select the path :"\ReconstructMe\Matlab Codes to be Included"

2. To generate Figure data about 3D-2D mapping in the manuscript, open the MATLAB file:
  "\ReconstructMe\RecMe_to_IR_by_Calibration_using_0521_images_All_models_SHIFT.m",
   
   --> press F5 in MATLAB to execute the file, which will pop out the figures data consecutively

   --> Folder:"Fig 14_(1218 Left Cheek IR Imaging)" contains the image data and MATLAB files ("Fig14_Left_Temp_Shift_TC3.m") to generate 2D side view images in Fig.5.13

3. For the experimental data about cylindrical phantom: Figures 8 & 9 in the manuscript, open the MATLAB file:
  "\ReconstructMe\Figure 8_Pot Phantom Data (latest MAIN)\Main_Fig8_AnodizedAL_withExp_1112.m",
  
   --> press F5 in MATLAB to execute the file, which will pop out the figures consecutively
